# HuskyLens with Arduino

## Project Idea

The goal is to control the color of a single RGB LED using color detection. When the HuskyLens detects a specific color, the Arduino will light up the corresponding color in the RGB LED:
- Red color â†’ Red light
- Green color â†’ Green light
- Blue color â†’ Blue light

## Components Needed

- HuskyLens AI Camera
- Arduino Uno (or similar)
- 1 RGB LED (Common Anode)
- 3 Resistors (220Î©)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- USB Cable (for power and programming)

## What is HuskyLens?

HuskyLens is an AI vision sensor that can detect and recognize faces, objects, colors, lines, and tags using built-in machine learning. Itâ€™s easy to use and integrates with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other microcontrollers via I2C or UART. It also features a built-in display for real-time visual feedback.

## RGB LED Overview

In this project, we use a **Common Anode RGB LED**, which has:

- One common positive (anode) pin connected to 5V
- Three separate pins for Red, Green, and Blue cathodes connected to Arduino pins via 220Î© resistors
- To turn on a color, the corresponding Arduino pin is set **LOW** (because the LED is common anode)

| Color | Arduino Pin |
|-------|-------------|
| Red   | D7          |
| Green | D9          |
| Blue  | D8          |

## HuskyLens to Arduino Wiring

| HuskyLens Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |
| TX            | A4 (SDA)    |
| RX            | A5 (SCL)    |

> ðŸ’¡ Note: The default communication protocol is I2C. For Arduino Uno, use A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL).
