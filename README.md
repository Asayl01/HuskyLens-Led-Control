# HuskyLens With arduinoo

## Introduction
### 1. What is HuskyLens?
HuskyLens is an AI vision sensor that can detect and recognize faces, objects, colors, lines, and tags using built-in machine learning. Itâ€™s easy to use and integrates with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other microcontrollers via I2C or UART. It also features a built-in display for real-time visual feedback.

### 2. Features
-  **Color Recognition** â€“ Detects and identifies trained colors.
-  **Face Recognition** â€“ Learns and recognizes human faces.
-  **Object Recognition** â€“ Identifies custom trained objects.
-  **Object Classification** â€“ Categorizes items into classes.
-  **Object Tracking** â€“ Follows moving objects automatically.
-  **Line Tracking** â€“ Tracks lines for robotics applications.
-  **Tag Recognition (AprilTag)** â€“ Reads visual markers like tags and IDs.


### 3. Applications

- Robotics and smart vehicle navigation  
- Face-based entry or security systems

##  5. HuskyLens to Arduino Wiring

| HuskyLens Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |
| TX            | A4 (SDA)    |
| RX            | A5 (SCL)    |

> ðŸ’¡ Note: The default communication protocol is I2C. Make sure you're using the correct pins depending on your Arduino board (for Uno: A4 = SDA, A5 = SCL).
